# Countries_API
Clickable world map in SVG format. Click on the country to get country and weather information.

### Basic information
This project uses two API's:
- Weather API from openweathermap
- Country information API from restcountries

When a country on the map is clicked, information is taken from countries API based on the two-letter code. Then weather is matched to the capital city of marked country.
